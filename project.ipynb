       "'# is chiang mai worth it?\\n\\n## Original Post\\n\\nhello! typical 20 something backpacker trash from the US here. i’ve been in\\nthailand for a week, just bangkok and the south, and wanted to get reddit’s\\nthoughts on this:  I have about 2 more weeks allotted for thailand, then a week\\nfor laos, then i’m off to vietnam.   I was going to do chiang mai and pai for\\nlike a week-ish before heading off to laos, but everything i’ve read about both\\nplaces says they’re so saturated in tourists (not that i’m helping). I’m not\\nconcerned about the smoke, I’m from northern california so we also have “free-\\ntrial-of-Hell” season 😂😂.   For a first time backpacker to SE asia, are pai and\\nchiang mai must-dos, or would it be more worth it to skip the tourist traps and\\nget authentic experiences in northern laos instead?\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n- The food alone is worth it IMO. and the atmosphere at night, cool little bars,\\n  live music smaller groups more intimate. Easy to meet people and not get too\\n  wild vs say Bangkok.   The vibe is very chill... \"slow life\" we call it.  Some\\n  cool stuff to see too depending on what you are interested in.\\n- For me, CM and the north are absolutely a must and I find it hilarious that\\n  you\\'ve been to the south (assuming islands) and call the north a tourist trap.\\n  It\\'s in the north (and Bangkok) that you meet the real Thailand, imo.\\n- Go eat some Khao Soi in Chiang Mai to earn the bragging rights when you go\\n  back home.\\n- I\\'m just curious, what is a \"typical 20 something backpacker trash\" ? 😆\\n- Chang mai and pai are a must imo\\n- We were just in Chiang Mai 10 days ago. We were also in Bangkok and Krabi.\\n  Bangkok is huge and chaotic, and mostly feels like an Asian metropolis. Krabi\\n  was either too provincial or too touristy depending on where we were. Chiang\\n  Mai is more of a mid-sized city, with trendy cafes, shops and bars, old\\n  neighborhoods and newer fancier ones. I think it felt a bit more like being in\\n  South East Asia in general, so it added that extra flavor to our trip.\\n- I loved chiang mai ! Just came from there yesterday and now in the south. If I\\n  were to do it again (which I would) I would: - skip Chiang Rai > way too\\n  touristy and horribly too hot to walk around and enjoy the temples tbh  - hang\\n  out at the sticky waterfalls, honestly so fun - Wat Pha La -> only temples\\n  I’ve cared about in Thailand and really serene  - Dantewada cafe -> beautiful\\n  waterfall “park” but looks like out of a fairytale could spend the whole day\\n  there\\n- You\\'ll be missing out if you don\\'t.  Very weird that you don\\'t consider\\n  bangkok and the south saturated with tourists but you think the north is?\\n  Northern Thailand is amazing. And right now I would say it\\'s quite quiet. Not\\n  so many tourists.  Go to Chiang Mai, eat some amazing food (I recommend Khao\\n  Soi Islam Noodles for Khao Soi). Don\\'t forget to check out the North Gate food\\n  market. Explore the Old City, check out some cool lil bars. See some live\\n  music at North Gate Jazz Co-op. Id also recommend \"The Simple man\" bar, the\\n  owner is a great guy. Go go the Sticky Waterfall, temples, Doi Suthep etc.\\n  Then get yourself up to Pai. Go \"Tipsy tubing\", go on some day trips, visit\\n  the Chinese Village, waterfalls (Though some of them might be pretty dry\\n  now?). Loads of great bars here, main recommend would be Almost Famous,\\n  amazing mojitos. Also Jikko Beer. Catch a sunset at Pai Canyon (Not great if\\n  your scared of heights), catch another sunset at Two Huts on another evening.\\n  There\\'s a few different viewpoints around that are well worth it.  Just a\\n  note, if you do go to Pai and you go tubing, go with \"Tipsy tubing\" booked at\\n  Pai Authentic Travel. There\\'s another company (previously Jungle Tubing but\\n  changed it\\'s name to Tipsy Jungle Tubing) with some very deceitful and bad\\n  faith business practices.\\n- I’ve been going to Thailand for the last 8 years. Basically live there at this\\n  point. I’d been everywhere. But I never went to Chiang Mai. Until late last\\n  year. I loved it. I would go. Rent a motorcycle and do the loop. Visit some\\n  places outside of Chiang Mai. Chiang Dao. Chiang Rai. Or just stay right in\\n  Chiang Mai.  Definitely have breakfast at Breakfast World Chiang Mai.\\n  Definitely go to doi Inthanon. Definitely go to doi suthep.   I would go.\\n- I love Chiang Mai. Its has a chilled out slow living vibe. I used to climb up\\n  Doi Suthep with my bicycle, have some noodle, coffee or fresh strawberry\\n  smoothie up in the mountain. Then come back down for a 30b chicken rice at the\\n  university. When it gets super hot, get some coconut ice cream and kaniau\\n  mamuang near the gate.\\xa0\\n- Absolutely! I was there last week and it\\'s a great city to visit, a must I\\n  would say. Please, if you are going to the north, also visit Pai. If you like\\n  to scooter there, it\\'s a really fun road from Chiang Mai to Pai and will only\\n  take about 3 hours or a bit longer if you take it easy.\\n- Absolutely worth it. Go further up into the mountains and stay at Mae Rim…so\\n  gorgeous and has the Queens elephant sanctuary and the restaurant at Proud Phu\\n  Fa Hip Resort. As authentic as it gets.\\n- Absolutely. One of my favorite places in Thailand. Do not skip it.\\n- if your in Thailand you DEFINITELY need to take the night train to Chiang mai.\\n  it\\'s such an awesome chilled out town with lots of stuff to do. plus there\\'s\\n  Chiang Rai about 6 hours away where they have magic mushroom shakes which\\n  taste fantastic if you so choose to indulge. :)\\n- If you like art in any shape or form, CM is a must\\n- Chiang Mai is cozy and cool, so different from Bangkok. Especially in the old\\n  city. Seems like other country in a way which is reasonable if we consider the\\n  fact that historically northern Thailand had their own kingdom. Even writing\\n  system was different. And i like that they wear traditional clothes much more\\n  often than in Bangkok or other big cities in Thailand. You can go to Sukhothai\\n  - another historical city - for 2 or 3 days and from there its like 4-5 hours\\n  of bus ride to CM Good luck my friend\\n- Absolutely worth it. Especially for Songkran Festival.\\n- Yes it’s worth it and so is Pai. Depends on what you mean by getting more\\n  authentic experiences though.\\n- The food is amazing! I stayed at a dream hotel while I was there and I\\n  absolutely can’t say enough good things!\\n- Just left Chiang Mai and so far it’s been the highlight of the trip.\\n  Definitely recommend. It is super hot but I’ve been hot since I got here 😂\\n- If I could only choose between Chiang Mai and BangKok, I much rather hang out\\n  in Chiang Mai.\\n- Cm is awesome, spent 3 weeks there. 3.5 months total all over Thailand. The\\n  Sunday night street market is a lot of fun and so much food to try. CM and Koh\\n  Samui were my top picks.\\n- Chaing Mai is one of my favourite city’s, I didnt make it to pai as ended up\\n  spending 7 days in cm\\n- My favourite city CM is cool and best from Nov to Jan\\n- Chiang Mai is 100% worth it, I’m here now then heading to Laos also on the\\n  7th! When I was in Pai I wasn’t the biggest fan but Chiang Mai is cool as fuck\\n- I liked Chiang Mai, never got to Pai. Songkran starts in a couple of weeks.\\n  Probably not good to be traveling that weekend.\\n- CM and area is quite nice to explore. Its a different facette of Thailand. I\\n  did not like Pai though.\\n- I loved Chiang Mai the most\\n- 2 major reasons: Khao Soi, and Namton’s House Bar.\\n- Food in Chiang Mai was some of my favorite. Since it’s smaller of the major\\n  known cities or tourist hubs it can feel over touristed but it’s still a place\\n  I’ll keep returning too.\\n- Yes absolutely. My only regret on my trip was spending more time in Bangkok\\n  than Chiang Mai.\\n- I loved Chiang Mai!!! The vibe there is so chill!!   If you are going to go -\\n  Stamps is supposed to be a really good hostel, my friends were staying there,\\n  I had already booked the Amora hotel round the corner. Both are great location\\n  just outside the city wall. Khao Soi is 👌👌 I would go back just to eat more of\\n  that. I also did a cooking class with Aromdii which I would highly recommend!!\\n  Also go for a Sunday night for the market it’s enormous, I got some really\\n  cool art for 500baht!  I didn’t go to Pai as I only had 3 days up north but I\\n  think you can do it as a day trip from Chiang mai if you don’t want to stay\\n  there.\\n- I was in Chiang Mai for two nights and really liked it. Wished I had more\\n  time. I did a one day Viator tour that included an elephant sanctuary, the top\\n  of Thailand’s tallest mountain, and a jungle hike. That was the best part of\\n  my Thailand visit. But I also loved the other wats on the surrounding\\n  mountains and walking around the old town. The artist night market on Sunday\\n  night was awesome. I didn’t get to see everything I wanted to see so I would\\n  say a week in Chiang Mai is totally worth it.\\n- This! (and many other comments that are very accurately *pro* north and CM).\\n  One week would be enough for me between CM and CR.  I might reallocate the\\n  other week to VN but you weren’t clear how long you’d be in VN.  Laos would be\\n  a relatively short part of my Thailand-Laos-Vietnam trip  Dude is also totally\\n  right about calling the north a tourist trap after having been in the south.\\n  The north tends to have more Chinese tourists than the south\\n- If you go to Chiang Mai, get the pork leg (Khao ka moo), or that coarse\\n  grilled sausage. Don\\'t know what that\\'s called.\\xa0\\n- Yes. Doi Suthep Temple and Wat Phra Sing are must-see!\\n- Totally worth it. But in the old town.\\n- Well if youre looking for super authentic.... Youre definitely going to get\\n  more of that in Laos than in CM or Pai.... Both CM and Pai are tourist\\n  cities.... Which comes with many pros and cons... such as lots of things to\\n  do.  Theres lots of places in north Thailand that arent as touristy if that is\\n  your thing... Authentic.... Check out Nan, its like the hidden gem of the\\n  north (maybe I shouldn\\'t advertise it here)... River town. Just see the Google\\n  images and thank me later.  You can also check out Chiang Rai, Mae Sai and\\n  Chiang Saen.\\n- i\\'m here in phuket at the moment, am about to go onto the islands. we have 2\\n  months total. i very briefly visited chiang mai on my last trip - 5 days, and\\n  i can say that the food is in my opinion my favourite + the architecture and\\n  landscapes are beautiful. only reason we didn\\'t add it to the itinerary this\\n  time around is the air quality right now, bangkok was enough north for us. we\\n  will do chiang mai and pai at another time of the year.\\n- Everywhere new is worth it, each experience is different for every person, I\\n  never understand these cherry picking posts, listening to other people takes\\n  away a lot of the experience, the bad times are something you need to have to\\n  get the most from backpacking, you’ll  learn a few things about yourself.\\n  Everybody says places are tourist saturated but they only go to the places\\n  specifically for tourists, even in Bangkok you can live a 5 minute bike ride\\n  from asok BTS and never see a tourist if you choose, just look up places you\\n  think you’d like and go, and go see for yourself, you can always move on if\\n  it’s not your thing 👍\\n- The vibes in Chiang Mai are immaculate, everything felt so chill, the locals\\n  are absolute sweethearts, I didn’t encounter anyone trying to scam me or other\\n  bullshit.  I think everyone should visit Chiang Mai when visiting Thailand .\\n  Go to Elephant nature park! I did the highlands tour, so worth it.\\n- *authentic experiences*\\xa0  No smartphones, no cars? We like to take care of our\\n  culture doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not authentic. For example, people from neighboring\\n  countries still come to Thailand to study Thai traditional dance, Pali\\n  language to this day. I\\'m in awe you think Thai culture in Thailand is not\\n  authentic when it\\'s us have been sharing our knowledge to others.\\n  [https://thebuddh.com/?p=75882](https://thebuddh.com/?p=75882)  And If you\\'re\\n  a mountain person, Northern VN is the most scenic. Southern Laos has Anthrax\\n  outbreak rn.\\n- Absolutely. This year will be our 3rd year going there to live for a month.\\n  What my wife and I liked the most was slow pace of things, good food, the\\n  general chill vibe of the city, and COFFEE. OMG so many coffee shops\\n  everywhere!  We\\'re seriously considering if we should semi-permantly move\\n  there or at least get an apartment in the near future. We both work remotely\\n  so work isn\\'t that big of an issue for us.\\n- Just go to Chiang Rai, better food and better sights. Chiang Mai is ok but\\n  probably my least liked \"tourist\" destination in Thailand. Just my opinion.\\n  Doesn\\'t mean it\\'s bad, I\\'ve enjoyed every time I was there but to me, there a\\n  so many better places. Thai wife so we go for at least a month every year.\\n- If you love the mountain it’s a must. A lot of nature and hikes around CM.\\n- It’s worth it if you go eat Khao Soi at Mr Kai’s\\n- Simple answer, yes. Go further north as well.\\n- Chiang Mai is great and way better than Bangkok or Phuket IMO\\n- Looking at Chiang Mai in Oct 2024.  Are there any recommended areas for\\n  accommodation or food / restaurants ??  thanks\\n- I enjoyed Chiang Mai. is def different pace it seems from the south. - I look\\n  forward to being back, but for alternate reasons from the temples/hikes/eats.\\n  -- If you have a spare few days, stop in.\\n- We spent 3 weeks in northern Thailand in December and absolutely loved it. 2\\n  of those weeks was a road trip which included the Mae Hong Son loop and then\\n  we headed further north before ending in Chiang Rai. I did a video series of\\n  the road trip here.\\n  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqsPnQnZAxlyJPHAKElfHdF-\\n  sWR7iBPod&si=0CTa9Z2nfq5NHTWh\\n- Watch your ass in Laos. I\\'m not fucking with you.\\n- I would possibly skip Pai.  It\\'s a bit of a cliche now.\\n- CM is at 30% occupancy at the moment.\\n- If you really travel in the north you will see real Thailand if you go to CM\\n  and just hanging around old city and then Pai you will see nothing.\\n- Pai was my favourite place in northern Thailand. Was supposed to stay 3 days\\n  and stayed 5. Really chilled out backpacker place with less holiday tourists.\\n- Laos is gonna be your favourite and you\\'ll wish you spent more than a week\\n  there.   Chiang Mai is great though\\n- Yes worth it. I don’t think they’re touristy compared to the south\\n- Yes! Elephants,quite place, and the Cabaret Show😆\\n- Sure it is..\\n- I love the north! Chiangmai is a must! Pai is a gorgeous area. The town itself\\n  was a little too backpacker boutique style for my preference. I heard\\n  Chiangrai is great and has that really cool looking white temple I’ve been\\n  wanting to see.   For northern foods, I love khao soi and nam ngiao as well as\\n  the sai uwa sausages the region is known for. If you are adventurous, they\\n  have a signature larb salad made with fresh blood and bile. I’m curious to try\\n  it but it seems a little outside my wheelhouse\\n- Hey check out my trip report on Chiang Mai. It’s defo worth it xx\\n  https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/s/twWOYFHT3a\\n- Sign up for one day free meditation experience at a local university if you\\n  have time. It is a great way to learn about monks daily routines and making\\n  connections.\\n- Chiang mai is pretty cool. It’s probably the hippiest-type of place you’ll\\n  find in SEA. There’s a lot of chill people there from all over the world.\\n  Architecturally it’s a pretty intriguing city with ancient gates and moats in\\n  a square feudal-vibes’ pattern. It’s a great city to walk around and snack and\\n  chill.\\n- I have been to Chiang Mai 3 weeks ago. I visited Krabi for first time (it was\\n  great, relaxing and beautiful). Then I flew to Chiang Mai. To be honest, I\\n  hesitated a lot before going there because of some sub-reddit comments about\\n  it that says \"if you like beaches don\\'t go to Chiang Mai\". I do agree with\\n  that. I stayed for 5 days which I felt 3 days were enough. I like Thailand\\n  stunning beaches which Chiang Mai lacks of.\\n- Call me crazy but I’ve never liked Chang Mai. It’s like the Portland Oregon of\\n  Thailand.\\n- I\\'ve hardly seen any western tourists in Chiang Mai this week, the air\\n  pollution and heat must have scared them off. Lots of Thai\\'s and Chinese.\\n  Hardly crowded, probably be of the better times to visit. It\\'s as really hot,\\n  but dry hot, so I find it quite pleasant at 38°c\\n- Definitely go! As you are heading to Laos anyways after, see if you are up for\\n  a slow boat into Laos (Luang Prabang) from Chaing rai / Chiang mai. It takes\\n  about 2-3 days but if definitely a backpack adventure checklist\\n- I have a home in Chiang Mai that I visit once a year. Do Chiang Mai. You won’t\\n  need a week though\\n- Yes great city\\n- Yes yes yes\\n- Pai is super touristy, Chiang Mai doesn’t feel that way. It’s big and the\\n  tourists stick to specific areas (night bazaar, Tha Phae, and parts of the old\\n  city). The rest you won’t bump into many tourists\\n- This is what we got up to in Chiang Mai.. check it out see if anything takes\\n  your fancy x  https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/s/w5v1GwbSvJ\\n- I\\'d say skip and go to Lao straight\\xa0\\n- It’s a nice town but quite small so would not stay there too long\\n- Theres not much to do im there now\\n\\n#### URL\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1btp263/is_chiang_mai_worth_it/'"

I loved looking at the temples,\\n  especially Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep and Wat Chedi Luang. Night market is\\n  definitely a must do. 2. Khao soi is the best! Street food is a really great\\n  way to try a little bit of everything. 3. Driving out to Huay Tung Tao lake\\n  was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can sit out on the lake and\\n  relax and eat.  4. I would say a week! If you\\'re into non-touristy stuff you\\n  might also enjoy checking out Chiang Rai, particularly the White Temple and\\n  the Black House.\\n- Hello! Chiang Mai is such a wonderful, unassuming city. So you’re already\\n  making a great decision to visit!  1) There are plenty of tours that offer to\\n  take you to see elephants. Just make sure you choose one that doesn’t let you\\n  ride them. I’ve done it with [Blue Elephant Thailand\\n  Tours](https://www.blueelephantthailandtours.com/) and since we did a super\\n  early morning one, it was like having a private session with the elephants. It\\n  was quite wonderful actually!   2) Read here for my fave spots - [Where to Eat\\n  in Chiang Mai](https://link.medium.com/UREEouDpe0). I also highly recommend\\n  doing a cooking class! [Thai Akha Kitchen](https://www.thaiakhakitchen.com/)\\n  is awesome. The lady is hilarious and she takes you to a market to shop first\\n  to try some goodies and get your ingredients. Super fun!  3) While these are a\\n  little touristy, I still think you can have a great time -  In the city: - Go\\n  temple hopping within the walled city. There are so many to see and all within\\n  walking distance of each other. - Sunday Night Market to get fun souvenirs or\\n  to just taste all the local deliciousness. - 6ixcret for a lady boy show!\\n  Seriously, so much fun. The cost is just 2 drinks during the show which they\\n  don’t really enforce.  - You can hike up to Doi Suthep temple. Do it early to\\n  catch the beautiful sunrise from the top (might involve some hiking in the\\n  dark though...)  Outside the city: - Doi Inthanon Park to visit the beautiful\\n  pagodas! There are hiking trails here too. - Sticky Waterfall to literally\\n  scale up a waterfall. Super fun! - Chiang Rai is a bit far, so this is\\n  definitely a day trip. Cool to see all the colored temples but if that’s not\\n  your shtick then I wouldn’t recommend going.  4) A couple of days stay is\\n  good! You could explore the within the city for 1-2 days, and also do some\\n  stuff outside the city for 1-2 days as well.   Getting around the city is easy\\n  too. You can use Grab (which is like their version of Uber/Lyft in most Asian\\n  cities). If you’d rather bike they have Mobike around the city for rental\\n  (you’ll need to download the app). Or you can just walk! The best and cheapest\\n  way is to use a red van. They drive all over the city so just flag one down\\n  and ask if they can take you where you wanna go. It’s a flat fee of 30 baht\\n  per person. It’s not the fastest way to get around but definitely one of the\\n  easiest on your wallet. You can also hail a bike/tuktuk too, but make sure to\\n  see how much it would cost on Grab first to help negotiate a good price.\\n  Hope that helps! :)\\n- I was there for five days in August and I have to say do “the monks walk” to\\n  wat pha lat! It’s amazing and my favorite thing I did in Chiang Mai. Here’s\\n  the [guide](https://www.globotreks.com/destinations/thailand-\\n  destinations/hiking-monks-trail-wat-pha-lat-chiang-mai/)  I used.\\n- I completely fell in love with the city once I had a motorbike. You\\'ll be able\\n  to go to all the places, see all the things, eat all the foods, whenever you\\n  want. If you\\'re feeling adventurous at all I cannot recommend this enough.\\n- Elephant Nature Park is the best! One of my favourite days ever. Book well in\\n  advance.   I stayed 4 nights, but would have happily stayed longer. Such a\\n  lovely place. Doi Suthep is definitely worth visiting. We walked around a lot,\\n  had amazing coffee at various coffee shops, and enjoyed local cuisine.\\n- I really enjoyed the night bazaar and the food vendors there. Delicious food.\\n  Definitely eat Khao Soi, as far as cooking classes go, I’ve used “Cooking\\n  @home Chiang Mai” on two occasions and it was both fun and delicious.\\n- We did a cooking class at Mama Noi’s and it was one of the best highlights of\\n  our trip! Would especially recommend since you mention liking food! The food\\n  we made there was amazing and it was a really fun experience.\\n- [deleted]\\n- For a day/ maybe 2 day trip you can take a van north to pai! very pretty and\\n  calm town, it’s very scenic and full of nature to explore. also about an hour\\n  outside of Chiang Mai there was a waterfall called “sticky waterfall”. because\\n  of the calcium deposits in it, you can pretty easily just walk up the\\n  waterfall. it was a blast and i would recommend looking into it\\n- >2) What are some of the must have food? (I have heard that Khao soi is\\n  amazing)  If you\\'ve never had it you\\'ll like Khao Soi but if you get a chance\\n  visit a Lanna (northern Thai) restaurant as there\\'s so much more to Lanna\\n  food. Two recommended dishes - Gaeng Hung Lay and Nam Prik Ong but there are\\n  plenty of others and it\\'s completely different to central Thai food, the Thai\\n  food you get in restaurants overseas.   >3) What are some of the must go to\\n  locations that are not that touristy?  If you\\'ve got enough time and can get\\n  the transport, [Wat\\n  Chalermprakiat](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/gallery/lampang-thailand-\\n  gallery/index.html?gallery=0) in Lampang, the so-called \"temple in the clouds\"\\n  is well worth a visit.  Because its takes about two hours to get to and it\\'s a\\n  little out of the way it\\'s not inundated with tourists - there are tourists\\n  but nothing like the closer, better known Wats like Wat Phra That Doi Suthep.\\n  Chae Son National Park which is about 30-45 minutes north of there is also\\n  worth a visit - natural hot springs.  Depending on what time of the year\\n  you\\'re visiting Doi Inthanon, Thailand\\'s highest mountain is also worth\\n  visiting.

       " Document(metadata={'comments': '### Comments\\n- Sticky waterfall: a wonder that will mess with your brain.   North gate jazz\\n  co-op: little jazz bar that always seems like the only place in Chiangmai full\\n  of people. Open mike nights and very lively.   Elely cafe: little riverside\\n  cafe with 2 elephants. Which are massively overshadowed by about 20\\n  dachshunds.\\n- I spent a month in CM and put this [Chiang Mai\\n  guide](https://travelhiatus.com/the-perfect-4-days-in-chiang-mai-itinerary/)\\n  together, hope it helps :)\\n- Stay near the moat. Walk everywhere. Avoid nothing (except elephant camps and\\n  those crazy “hill tribe camps”). Try whatever catches your eye. Try any food.\\n  Why do you want to do what others have already done? It’s your trip. Make it\\n  your trip. Night markets will have souvenir-y things. Why sit in a bar? If you\\n  will, sit in a bar with live music. You’ll hear/finds lots around the moat and\\n  in the old city. You only have 4 days. Don’t rent scooters. Walk. Everywhere.\\n  Have fun.\\n- 1: Avoid - Afternoon storms. This is the time to sit at a bar/cafe and watch\\n  the world splash by. (with mosquito coils under the table).  2: Food - Try\\n  everything but bugs   3: Visit - If the heat gets to you, try Doi Inthanon, it\\n  can be actually quite cool up there. I would stay overnight at one of the\\n  bungalows on the rice paddy\\'s on a small farm. There are several waterfalls in\\n  the area and great ma & pa coffee stalls. Weekdays are quite peaceful.  4:\\n  Elephant camps - Havnt been, not for me but if you haven\\'t been then you can\\'t\\n  really express a public opinion so find the most humane one and go.  5:\\n  Trinkets- CM is the market capital of the north so many options. Even though\\n  the Sunday market is so busy and touristy, some locals make their own stuff\\n  and sell here. The village of Baan Tawai has lots of hand made items, mainly\\n  wood, so customs declaration required going home.  6: Chill bars- There are\\n  just so many in the old city, Nimman, and surrounds, all safe. There are a\\n  range of rooftop bars from hi-so to lay layback venues, googs has a list. As\\n  mentioned, North Gate Jazz is popular but gets busy with patrons flowing out\\n  to the street. Lost Hut was cute and Zoe for the backpacker crew who like doof\\n  doof dancing. Lots of upmarket wine bars/beer labs in Nimman. Some nice venues\\n  across the river like Riverside, with live music and ramshackle wooden shack\\n  atmosphere, with the popular Thai venue, Good View, just up the road. Go early\\n  and sit at the bar and watch the band get going, probably 90% locals.  7:\\n  Advice - Grab a rain poncho at the 7/11 and go with the flow\\n- 4. Elephant Nature Park. That\\'s the one. That\\'s the only one you should visit.\\n  Virtually all the rest of them are privately owned, for-profit places with a\\n  long history of abuse. Please don\\'t support the other places.\\n- visited elephant sanctuary a month ago. got to feed, scratch and bathe with\\n  elephants. that was pretty neat.  no riding or other circus activities\\n- Hung Lay curry.\\n- 1) Don\\'t use Tuktuks for transportation, use Grab, Bold, Indriver or Maxim. If\\n  you want to just try a Tuktuk for fun go for it, but it\\'s mostly a tourist\\n  thing and prices are much higher that other transport.   2) Pad Thai is mostly\\n  a tourist dish and most Thai people don\\'t really eat it. Try if of course but\\n  there\\'s much better dishes. Most popular dish in Thailand with locals is Pad\\n  krapow (stir fried port with basil). But just try lots of different things.\\n  3) Not sure about underrated but Doi Suthep temple is nice, various\\n  waterfalls, night market.  4) Elephant Nature Park is the most famous one and\\n  is nice if you want to spend the day walking around with elephants, bathing\\n  them etc. If you want something more relaxed then Chai Lai Orchid is nice.\\n  They have a cafe so you can just go and eat or have a drink and they have\\n  elephants wallking around. In the afternoon they feed the elephants in front\\n  of the cafe. You can also do a photo session where you walk around with an\\n  elephant and a handler and can take photos in different locations on the\\n  property. Plus they have accommodation if you want to stay overnight (need to\\n  book it\\'s very popular).  5) Warorot market you can get most of the stuff they\\n  sell at the night market but much cheaper.    6) The White Rabbit is the best\\n  cocktail bar in Chiang Mai, it\\'s a small speakeasy bar. Some nice rooftop bars\\n  for sunset are Hotel Yayee, Rise Bar, Barglory, Mai Sky Bar, Hong\\'s Sky Bar.\\n  Nort Gate Jazz for live music (but gets very busy).  7) Do not rent a scooter\\n  unless you have a lot of experience riding motorbike and a full motorbike\\n  license. Thailand is a dangerous place to ride for beginners.\\n- Thapae east for music :)\\n- Spend a night in Monjam in these \"bubble\" \"Glamping\" hotels with a beautiful\\n  view on the mountains.\\n- The old city, the \\'main square\\' of the city, is the most populated with\\n  tourists and is gearded towards them. I recommend you explore any area around\\n  the main city to discover the more \\'thai-based\\' places. Around CMU University\\n  is lovely.\\n- Elephant Jungle Sanctuary. We did the overnight stay option. Our guide Tomas\\n  was awesome and hilarious. No riding the elephants. We fed them, walked\\n  through the jungle with them, and bathed them. Since we did the overnight\\n  option we got to go visit their other sanctuaries too.\\n- Chai Lai orchard.  Book early.\\n- Go to a cooking class Go to a Muay Thai fight\\n- [deleted]\\n- If you’re in CM on a weekend we love Jing Jai Market.\\n- Idk when you\\'re going but Elephant Nature Park Highlands had a baby elephant\\n  when I visited last month. 8 months old and was super cute. Definitely\\n  recommend going to the Highlands.  If your adventurous and know how to ride a\\n  bike, I did an enduro tour. I\\'ve never ridden a proper dirt bike but they had\\n  the perfect spot to take me to where I only fell a couple times. With the gear\\n  it was no problem.  If you\\'re into hiking, Monk\\'s Trail was pretty cool too.\\n  Second half is tough as hell. Luckily the top of Doi Suthep has the red trucks\\n  to take you back to town for 100 baht or less. No chance I was going back down\\n  in the rain.  Doi Inthanon was ok but if you\\'re short on time I don\\'t think\\n  it\\'s worth putting it as high priority\\n- A bit further on up the road from the Elephant Sanctuary is a little resort\\n  called Proud Phu Fah resort. The restaurant there is small and wonderful.\\n- >Besides Khao Soi & Pad Thai, are there any local delicacy that is a must try\\n  ?  Pad Thai is not a local delicacy, but that aside, do make sure you explore\\n  Lanna (northern) Thai food of which khao soi is only one dish and there\\'s some\\n  great dishes to try, including nam prik ong, guang hung lay, sai ua and more.\\n  >Any nice chill bars that are safe to relax for the night ?  Chiang Mai\\n  regularly ranks as the safest city in Southeast Asia ahead of Singapore - as\\n  long as you avoid karaoke bars, you will be fine. For great music, Boy Blues\\n  Bar in the Night Bazaar.\\n- I really recommend a trip to Doi Inthanon\\n- Sticky waterfalls, it\\'s the most unique one of a kind waterfall in Thailand.\\n  Your welcome\\n- You have to try all you can eat bbq pork it\\'s < 300 thb/person local and\\n  university students love them (I also XP)\\n- 2. Pad Thai... I really like the pad Thai in food court of Central Airport\\n  (4th floor) near the cinema. She only sells pad thai. Each is made to order. I\\n  like the ancient/traditional version. I’ve been eating it for about ten years.\\n  Best bargain.\\n- go to the sunday market! I loved it\\n- I recommend Khao soi At KHAO-SO-I  The food is really good 🙌\\n- My husband, son, and I went to the Elephant Rescue park.  Absolutely\\n  fantastic!!!  We got to make herbal medicine for the elephants, feed them,\\n  give them baths, go with them into the jungle and help cut down banana trees\\n  for them to eat.  We were provided with a delicious vegan lunch.  We spent the\\n  whole day there.\\n- Sanctuaries with the most ethical standards -Elephant Nature Park, Asian\\n  Elephant Projects, Chang Chill, Kindred Spirits and Burm and Emily\\'s.  New\\n  Elephant Home is transitioning to ethical practices as well.  Avoid bathing,\\n  elephants do not want to be the water with dozens of strangers multiple times\\n  a day on a schedule.  They want to roll around and interact with their\\n  elephant buddies (which is prohibited for tourist safety).', 'content': \"Hello all!

First time\\ntravelling to Chiang Rai from overseas, would appreciate any form of guidance.\\nThank you.\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n- Sticky waterfall: a wonder that will mess with your brain.   North gate jazz\\n  co-op: little jazz bar that always seems like the only place in Chiangmai full\\n  of people. Open mike nights and very lively.   Elely cafe: little riverside\\n  cafe with 2 elephants. Which are massively overshadowed by about 20\\n  dachshunds.\\n- I spent a month in CM and put this [Chiang Mai\\n  guide](https://travelhiatus.com/the-perfect-4-days-in-chiang-mai-itinerary/)\\n  together, hope it helps :)\\n- Stay near the moat. Walk everywhere. Avoid nothing (except elephant camps and\\n  those crazy “hill tribe camps”). Try whatever catches your eye. Try any food.\\n  Why do you want to do what others have already done? It’s your trip. Make it\\n  your trip. Night markets will have souvenir-y things. Why sit in a bar? If you\\n  will, sit in a bar with live music. You’ll hear/finds lots around the moat and\\n  in the old city. You only have 4 days. Don’t rent scooters. Walk. Everywhere.\\n  Have fun.\\n- 1: Avoid - Afternoon storms. This is the time to sit at a bar/cafe and watch\\n  the world splash by. (with mosquito coils under the table).  2: Food - Try\\n  everything but bugs   3: Visit - If the heat gets to you, try Doi Inthanon, it\\n  can be actually quite cool up there. I would stay overnight at one of the\\n  bungalows on the rice paddy\\'s on a small farm. There are several waterfalls in\\n  the area and great ma & pa coffee stalls. Weekdays are quite peaceful.  4:\\n  Elephant camps - Havnt been, not for me but if you haven\\'t been then you can\\'t\\n  really express a public opinion so find the most humane one and go.  5:\\n  Trinkets- CM is the market capital of the north so many options. Even though\\n  the Sunday market is so busy and touristy, some locals make their own stuff\\n  and sell here. The village of Baan Tawai has lots of hand made items, mainly\\n  wood, so customs declaration required going home.  6: Chill bars- There are\\n  just so many in the old city, Nimman, and surrounds, all safe. There are a\\n  range of rooftop bars from hi-so to lay layback venues, googs has a list. As\\n  mentioned, North Gate Jazz is popular but gets busy with patrons flowing out\\n  to the street. Lost Hut was cute and Zoe for the backpacker crew who like doof\\n  doof dancing. Lots of upmarket wine bars/beer labs in Nimman. Some nice venues\\n  across the river like Riverside, with live music and ramshackle wooden shack\\n  atmosphere, with the popular Thai venue, Good View, just up the road. Go early\\n  and sit at the bar and watch the band get going, probably 90% locals.  7:\\n  Advice - Grab a rain poncho at the 7/11 and go with the flow\\n- 4. Elephant Nature Park. That\\'s the one. That\\'s the only one you should visit.\\n  Virtually all the rest of them are privately owned, for-profit places with a\\n  long history of abuse. Please don\\'t support the other places.\\n- visited elephant sanctuary a month ago. got to feed, scratch and bathe with\\n  elephants. that was pretty neat.  no riding or other circus activities\\n- Hung Lay curry.\\n- 1) Don\\'t use Tuktuks for transportation, use Grab, Bold, Indriver or Maxim. If\\n  you want to just try a Tuktuk for fun go for it, but it\\'s mostly a tourist\\n  thing and prices are much higher that other transport.   2) Pad Thai is mostly\\n  a tourist dish and most Thai people don\\'t really eat it. Try if of course but\\n  there\\'s much better dishes. Most popular dish in Thailand with locals is Pad\\n  krapow (stir fried port with basil). But just try lots of different things.\\n  3) Not sure about underrated but Doi Suthep temple is nice, various\\n  waterfalls, night market.  4) Elephant Nature Park is the most famous one and\\n  is nice if you want to spend the day walking around with elephants, bathing\\n  them etc. If you want something more relaxed then Chai Lai Orchid is nice.\\n  They have a cafe so you can just go and eat or have a drink and they have\\n  elephants wallking around. In the afternoon they feed the elephants in front\\n  of the cafe. You can also do a photo session where you walk around with an\\n  elephant and a handler and can take photos in different locations on the\\n  property. Plus they have accommodation if you want to stay overnight (need to\\n  book it\\'s very popular).  5) Warorot market you can get most of the stuff they\\n  sell at the night market but much cheaper.    6) The White Rabbit is the best\\n  cocktail bar in Chiang Mai, it\\'s a small speakeasy bar. Some nice rooftop bars\\n  for sunset are Hotel Yayee, Rise Bar, Barglory, Mai Sky Bar, Hong\\'s Sky Bar.\\n  Nort Gate Jazz for live music (but gets very busy).  7) Do not rent a scooter\\n  unless you have a lot of experience riding motorbike and a full motorbike\\n  license. Thailand is a dangerous place to ride for beginners.\\n- Thapae east for music :)\\n- Spend a night in Monjam in these \"bubble\" \"Glamping\" hotels with a beautiful\\n  view on the mountains.\\n- The old city, the \\'main square\\' of the city, is the most populated with\\n  tourists and is gearded towards them. I recommend you explore any area around\\n  the main city to discover the more \\'thai-based\\' places. Around CMU University\\n  is lovely.\\n- Elephant Jungle Sanctuary. We did the overnight stay option. Our guide Tomas\\n  was awesome and hilarious. No riding the elephants. We fed them, walked\\n  through the jungle with them, and bathed them. Since we did the overnight\\n  option we got to go visit their other sanctuaries too.\\n- Chai Lai orchard.  Book early.\\n- Go to a cooking class Go to a Muay Thai fight\\n- [deleted]\\n- If you’re in CM on a weekend we love Jing Jai Market.\\n- Idk when you\\'re going but Elephant Nature Park Highlands had a baby elephant\\n  when I visited last month. 8 months old and was super cute. Definitely\\n  recommend going to the Highlands.  If your adventurous and know how to ride a\\n  bike, I did an enduro tour. I\\'ve never ridden a proper dirt bike but they had\\n  the perfect spot to take me to where I only fell a couple times. With the gear\\n  it was no problem.  If you\\'re into hiking, Monk\\'s Trail was pretty cool too.\\n  Second half is tough as hell. Luckily the top of Doi Suthep has the red trucks\\n  to take you back to town for 100 baht or less. No chance I was going back down\\n  in the rain.  Doi Inthanon was ok but if you\\'re short on time I don\\'t think\\n  it\\'s worth putting it as high priority\\n- A bit further on up the road from the Elephant Sanctuary is a little resort\\n  called Proud Phu Fah resort. The restaurant there is small and wonderful.\\n- >Besides Khao Soi & Pad Thai, are there any local delicacy that is a must try\\n  ?  Pad Thai is not a local delicacy, but that aside, do make sure you explore\\n  Lanna (northern) Thai food of which khao soi is only one dish and there\\'s some\\n  great dishes to try, including nam prik ong, guang hung lay, sai ua and more.\\n  >Any nice chill bars that are safe to relax for the night ?  Chiang Mai\\n  regularly ranks as the safest city in Southeast Asia ahead of Singapore - as\\n  long as you avoid karaoke bars, you will be fine. For great music, Boy Blues\\n  Bar in the Night Bazaar.\\n- I really recommend a trip to Doi Inthanon\\n- Sticky waterfalls, it\\'s the most unique one of a kind waterfall in Thailand.\\n  Your welcome\\n- You have to try all you can eat bbq pork it\\'s < 300 thb/person local and\\n  university students love them (I also XP)\\n- 2. Pad Thai... I really like the pad Thai in food court of Central Airport\\n  (4th floor) near the cinema. She only sells pad thai. Each is made to order. I\\n  like the ancient/traditional version. I’ve been eating it for about ten years.\\n  Best bargain.\\n- go to the sunday market! I loved it\\n- I recommend Khao soi At KHAO-SO-I  The food is really good 🙌\\n- My husband, son, and I went to the Elephant Rescue park.  Absolutely\\n  fantastic!!!  We got to make herbal medicine for the elephants, feed them,\\n  give them baths, go with them into the jungle and help cut down banana trees\\n  for them to eat.  We were provided with a delicious vegan lunch.  We spent the\\n  whole day there.\\n- Sanctuaries with the most ethical standards -Elephant Nature Park, Asian\\n  Elephant Projects, Chang Chill, Kindred Spirits and Burm and Emily\\'s.  New\\n  Elephant Home is transitioning to ethical practices as well.  Avoid bathing,\\n  elephants do not want to be the water with dozens of strangers multiple times\\n  a day on a schedule.  They want to roll around and interact with their\\n  elephant buddies (which is prohibited for tourist safety).\\n\\n#### URL\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/1evxoyu/4_days_trip_in_chiang_mai_any_suggestions_for/'),\n",

Prepare   yourself for a great two day action packed adventure. All senses   tingling.\\n\\nIt is pretty difficult   to describe two of the best days of my entire life, but let me try.   First of all the people that accompanied us on these two days.. we   couldn't of asked for a better mix of nationalities, ages and BANTER   (Jokes&laughs)! The guides where dam right amazing! Knowledgeable,   caring, funny and perfect English. The overnight accommodation after the   first day was fab, a perfect place to rest your head after a busy day -   also an important cultural experience. Which we did no really get from   other more remote places we visited in Thailand. Karen Hill Tribe   Village. The place to be!\\n\\nThis is how our day panned out.. ill write a basic itinerary (which will still be lengthy I must add).\\n\\n**Itinerary**\\n\\n1. **Hotel pickup** (Either by Van or a traditional **songthaew**)\\n2. Arrive at **local markets** (sample local **delicacies** and immerse yourself in **local culture**)\\n3. **Bamboo Rafting**  ( Mae Wang River ) **F ME THIS WAS FUN!**\\n4. Hike through paddy fields & **forest** to a **hidden Waterfall**\\n5. **Picnic Lunch beside the Waterfall**\\n6. **Refresh in the Waterfall** (swimming is permitted! :)!!!!!!)\\n7. Trek Through **Bamboo & Evergreen Forests**\\n8. **Karen   Hill Tribe Village (Eat delicious authentic Thai with the locals - a   PROPER way to learn about Thai culture - This was a serious cultural   experience - I will be coming back to spend more time here for sure)**\\n9. **Spend the Night with the Karen Hill Tribe (Extremely memorable)**\\n10. **Trek through evergreen and bamboo forests**\\n11. **Elephant Sanctuary (Rescued Elephants only - extremely ethical!)**\\n12. **Feed bathe and Learn about the majestic creatures (respectful environment)**\\n13. Hotel Drop off.\\n\\nAs   you can see this is an absolute action packed adventure - I was never   bored - even whilst trekking  the scenic views, wildlife and the   continuous banter amongst the group and guides. This is in my opinion a **MUST DO**   whilst in Chiang Mai! This tour literally ticked every single box, it   was cultural, it was an adventure, the guides were brilliant.  Everything  about it was FAB! We also thought it was amazing value..  accommodation  included, rafting included and the elephant sanctuary  also included..  some of these tasks individually will cost the same  amount! I will be  returning to do this tour again next year. **LOVED IT!**\\n\\n**GYG LINK to MULTI-DAY JUNGLE TREK (ELEPHANT SANCTUARY & RAFTING):**\\n\\n[**https://www.getyourguide.com/chiang-mai-l271/2-days-1-night-trek-with-overnight-hill-tribe-stay-t492476/?partner\\\\_id=K1S6T5K&utm\\\\_medium=online\\\\_publisher**](https://www.getyourguide.com/chiang-mai-l271/2-days-1-night-trek-with-overnight-hill-tribe-stay-t492476/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)\\n\\n# Temples in Chiang Rai!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nei4eaum6bqc1.jpg?width=3886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1622ceae0b29f33ed1d5238aa7858dfcdcd125a6\\n\\nAs   I am sure some of you are aware Chiang Rai is known for its historical   and impressive temples. As well as its arts&crafts, cool weather  and  picturesque mountains. This was one of our best days in Chiang Mai,  it  was a guided tour of all the major temples in the area. Wat Rong  Khun  &  Wat Rong Suae Ten, the tour also included a trip to the  Baan Dam  Musuem (Black House Musuem). All of these locations are  absolute must  see's/dos when visiting the area.\\n\\nOur   guide Sunny was extremely knowledgeable with impeccable English (very   easy to understand) we felt as though he past on a wealth of knowledge.   His time management skills also on point, we felt as though we had  just  the right amount of time at every location. We would highly  recommend  Sunny if possible to guide you around.\\n\\n**Itinerary**\\n\\n1. Pick up from the old city wall in Chiang Mai (My understanding is that this is more flexible)\\n2. A luxury Van trip to Chiang Rai\\n3. **Mae Kachan Hot Spring** (impressive break time :)!)\\n4. **Wat Rong Khun** (White Temple - the most **AMAZING** temple ever! You have to see this!)\\n5. **Wat Rong Suae Ten**\\n6. **Bann Dan Musuem** (Black House Musuem)\\n7. Drop off\\n\\nas   you can see its a jam packed day full of must see's whilst in  Thailand.  Admittedly a lot of travelling but well worth it in our  opinion. 100%  recommend if you're spending more than 3 days in Chiang  Mai. As per  usual ill attach the link to our guide below.

I am   trying to recommend the core things to do for backpackers and tourist   alike that are spending a shorter amount of time in the area.\\n\\nI   do think Chiang Mai is a great place to do a Thai Cooking class  because  i think the province itself is more culturally in tune. We have  indeed  over the years done some of our best Thai cooking classes in  Chiang Mai.  The class I am going to recommend was one of the best we  have done in  Thailand. EXTREMELY AUTHENTIC!!!!\\n\\nOur Thai instructor Kiki was brilliant, an extremely good teacher with a lot of character! Take me back to KIKI's class please.\\n\\n**Itinerary**\\n\\n1. Hotel Pickup\\n2. Visit a local **organic farm** to **pick some vegetables, herbs and collect eggs**\\n3. **Visit the local market** ( Loads of questions, loads of knowledge a fundamental part of a good Thai cooking lesson)\\n4. Make your very own **coconut milk using a coconut grater**\\n5. **Make Curry paste from scratch!**\\n6. **Learn to make Tom Yum Koong, Pad Thai & Pad Kra Pao**\\n7. **Eat the fruits of your labour :)!**\\n8. Hotel Drop off\\n\\nThe   classes are a small size, class rooms just right and the instructor   (KIKI) is brilliant. What more could you ask for.

As well as its arts&crafts, cool weather  and  picturesque mountains.\\nThis was one of our best days in Chiang Mai,  it  was a guided tour of all the\\nmajor temples in the area. Wat Rong  Khun  &  Wat Rong Suae Ten, the tour also\\nincluded a trip to the  Baan Dam  Musuem (Black House Musuem). All of these\\nlocations are  absolute must  see's/dos when visiting the area.  Our   guide\\nSunny was extremely knowledgeable with impeccable English (very   easy to\\nunderstand) we felt as though he past on a wealth of knowledge.   His time\\nmanagement skills also on point, we felt as though we had  just  the right\\namount of time at every location. We would highly  recommend  Sunny if possible\\nto guide you around.  **Itinerary**  1. Pick up from the old city wall in Chiang\\nMai (My understanding is that this is more flexible) 2. A luxury Van trip to\\nChiang Rai 3. **Mae Kachan Hot Spring** (impressive break time :)!) 4. **Wat\\nRong Khun** (White Temple - the most **AMAZING** temple ever! You have to see\\nthis!) 5. **Wat Rong Suae Ten** 6. **Bann Dan Musuem** (Black House Musuem) 7.\\nDrop off  as   you can see its a jam packed day full of must see's whilst in\\nThailand.  Admittedly a lot of travelling but well worth it in our  opinion.\\n100%  recommend if you're spending more than 3 days in Chiang  Mai. As per\\nusual ill attach the link to our guide below.

I am   trying to\\nrecommend the core things to do for backpackers and tourist   alike that are\\nspending a shorter amount of time in the area.  I   do think Chiang Mai is a\\ngreat place to do a Thai Cooking class  because  i think the province itself is\\nmore culturally in tune. We have  indeed  over the years done some of our best\\nThai cooking classes in  Chiang Mai.  The class I am going to recommend was one\\nof the best we  have done in  Thailand. EXTREMELY AUTHENTIC!!!!  Our Thai\\ninstructor Kiki was brilliant, an extremely good teacher with a lot of\\ncharacter! Take me back to KIKI's class please.  **Itinerary**  1. Hotel Pickup\\n2. Visit a local **organic farm** to **pick some vegetables, herbs and collect\\neggs** 3. **Visit the local market** ( Loads of questions, loads of knowledge a\\nfundamental part of a good Thai cooking lesson) 4. Make your very own **coconut\\nmilk using a coconut grater** 5. **Make Curry paste from scratch!** 6. **Learn\\nto make Tom Yum Koong, Pad Thai & Pad Kra Pao** 7. **Eat the fruits of your\\nlabour :)!** 8. Hotel Drop off  The   classes are a small size, class rooms just\\nright and the instructor   (KIKI) is brilliant. What more could you ask for.

      "Some of the underrated or secret spots in Chiang Mai that tourists often miss include Wat Umong, which is a temple with tunnels and is quite different from the famous temples in the city center. Baan Kang Wat is another hidden gem, an artistic village with independent shops and cafes. Huay Tung Thao Reservoir offers a peaceful setting for a swim and barbecue, often frequented by locals rather than tourists. Mae Kampong and Mon Jam in Mae Rim are great for camping or glamping and are perfect for escaping the city noise. Chiang Dao, with its impressive Wat Tham Pha Plong and Wat Tham Chiang Dao temples, also provides a less touristy experience. These places offer unique experiences away from the typical tourist traps.\n",

      "The current situation with tourists in Chiang Mai as of 2024 seems to be relatively quiet compared to the high season. In May and June, it's considered low season, and there are fewer tourists than at the end of the year. The city is experiencing a heatwave which, combined with the burning season, has resulted in less tourist traffic. Despite this, there are still some tourists, particularly Asian tourists, but overall it's quieter than during cooler months. The quietness is attributed to the heat and poor air quality due to smog, which makes it less attractive for tourists at the moment.\n",

      "A: Based on recent Reddit discussions:\n",
      "The best way to get around Chiang Mai is to avoid using Tuk Tuks for transportation as they tend to be more expensive and are mostly a tourist attraction. Instead, it's recommended to use ride-hailing apps such as Grab, Bold, Indriver, or Maxim for more cost-effective transportation. Additionally, staying near the moat and walking everywhere is advised as you can explore the city more freely. Renting a scooter is not recommended unless you have significant riding experience and a full motorbike license due to the dangers for beginners on Thai roads.\n",

Additionally, it's generally suggested to avoid the \"hill tribe camps,\" which can be commercialized and exploitative. It's also wise to avoid using Tuktuks for transportation as they tend to charge significantly higher rates compared to other transport options like Grab or Bold.

       "[1] \"I really loved Wat Umong, it's a temple a bit outside of town and it consists of tunnels. I really liked it because it's quite a bit different from all the big famous temples in the centre. Close to Wat Umong is Baan Kang Wat which is a little artistic village with a lot of independet shops and cafés. If you want to go for a swim I would suggest going to Huay Tung Thao Reservoir. It's a really pretty lake and you can rent huts and have a barbecue there. If you want to leave Chiang Mai for a day or two and like to go camping or glamping I would suggest going to Mae Kampong or Mon Jam in Mae Rim. Both aren't too far away from Chiang Mai. Another place I absolutely loved was Chiang Dao which is about 1,5 hours away from Chiang Mai. I visited Wat Tham Pha Plong and Wat Tham Chiang Dao which was a temple inside of a cave.\" - [source_url](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/123syod/interesting_different_things_to_do_in_chiang_mai/)\n",
