       "\"# Yi Peng/Loi Krathong 2024\\n\\n## Original Post\\n\\nHey everyone!  My Girl and me want to visit Thailand in November. We saw that\\naround the 15./16. of November there will be the Yi Peng and Loi Krathong\\nfestivities in Chiang Mai. It is not easy to get an overview of what to expect\\nthere. So I am grateful for any information!   So here are a few questions:  -\\nDo we need to attend the paid festival by CAD? Or is this just a touristic cash\\ngrab? - Where to get a lantern? - Are we allowed to let a lantern start from\\nwithin the city?  - What is a “must see” at that time in Chiang mai? e.g. any\\nspecial ceremonies? Parades? - Is there like a timetable what is happening when\\nin the city?   Thank & Cheers!\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n- There is events you can pay to go, but I would advise against it. It's very\\n  simple festival, go to any bridge on the ping river, there is lanterns\\n  everywhere to buy from street vendors, you can buy flowers to set on the water\\n  etc. You dont have to stress to much about time, when the sun goes down around\\n  7 is when you can expect the lanterns to raise to the air. Go have a nice\\n  dinner near ping river (Riverside or The Dukes, and when dinner is done go to\\n  the river and enjoy the sights and buy some lanterns and some flower\\n  decorations to give to the water spirits ( which is from my understanding what\\n  the whole festival Loi Krathong is about)   I hired a photographer for 2 hours\\n  in 2017 and got some amazing shots with me and my family.\\n- Hey, I was in CM for Yi Peng/Loi Krathong last November, it was very good. No\\n  need to go to the paid festival, the city centre (particularly around the\\n  river area) is absolutely buzzing with people/festivities and decorated\\n  beautifully.  In terms of launching lanterns from the city - people seemed to\\n  be launching them mostly from Nawarat Bridge (literally hundreds, maybe\\n  thousands). I can't endorse this though as it's banned due to fire risk. It\\n  also can't be great for the environment / wildlife. Unfortunately there was a\\n  big fire last year that took hours to put out\\n  (https://www.nationthailand.com/thailand/general/40033278). I witnessed it\\n  from my balcony and it was a very sad sight. Apparently this has happed in\\n  previous years too. Fortunately I think nobody was hurt, but people probably\\n  lost homes, or at very least businesses.  Other than that, it was a really\\n  great festival. CM (and Thailand in general) has some of the strongest\\n  festival game I've ever seen. Each one truly magical and memorable. And yes,\\n  there was parade around the perimeter of the Old City on one of the last days,\\n  that was good too.  One thing I'd say is to try and book accommodation and\\n  flights (if that's how you'll be travelling) well in advance as a lot of\\n  people visit CM for this festival. I was there for the the whole of November\\n  and the influx was very noticeable. Afterwards, as my departure from CM\\n  happened to coincide with the end of Yi Peng/Loi Krathong, I ended up having\\n  to get a 10hr bus to BKK to just get a reasonably priced last(ish) minute\\n  flight to HCM as this was \\\\~$300 from CM (usually $50-70 for this route). I\\n  imagine it would've been cheaper from CM if I'd booked more in advance.  Have\\n  a great time! I love CM so much, one of my favourite places in the world. If\\n  you have time, drive \\\\~20mins from the centre (or get a Grab taxi for \\\\~300\\n  bhat) to Royal Park Rajapruek. Afterwards, you can also drive/taxi 5-10min up\\n  to Wat Phra That Doi Kham, the temple overlooking the park + has a great view\\n  over CM (if you go up by Grab taxi you may have to get a songthaew back down\\n  though as I'm not sure if Grab collect from up there, or perhaps you could try\\n  and tipping the Grab driver that took you up to wait for you). This area is\\n  truly special and relatively unknown / unvisited by tourists as it's a bit out\\n  of town.\\n- The paid event is worth it if you dgaf about the cost and want something less\\n  crowded and organized including transportation to/from and everything planned\\n  out.  There’s a free event at doi saket lakes which is fun but insanely\\n  overcrowded. It’s absolutely crazy how many people are here for it. We’re\\n  already sold out of beds for this year.\\n\\n#### URL\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/1cb3fx4/yi_pengloi_krathong_2024/\""
