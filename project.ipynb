       " Document(metadata={'comments': '### Comments\\n- 1. Definitely check out an elephant sanctuary (no riding!) and taking a\\n  cooking class (I really liked Asian Scenic.) I loved looking at the temples,\\n  especially Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep and Wat Chedi Luang. Night market is\\n  definitely a must do. 2. Khao soi is the best! Street food is a really great\\n  way to try a little bit of everything. 3. Driving out to Huay Tung Tao lake\\n  was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can sit out on the lake and\\n  relax and eat.  4. I would say a week! If you\\'re into non-touristy stuff you\\n  might also enjoy checking out Chiang Rai, particularly the White Temple and\\n  the Black House.\\n- Hello! Chiang Mai is such a wonderful, unassuming city. So you’re already\\n  making a great decision to visit!  1) There are plenty of tours that offer to\\n  take you to see elephants. Just make sure you choose one that doesn’t let you\\n  ride them. I’ve done it with [Blue Elephant Thailand\\n  Tours](https://www.blueelephantthailandtours.com/) and since we did a super\\n  early morning one, it was like having a private session with the elephants. It\\n  was quite wonderful actually!   2) Read here for my fave spots - [Where to Eat\\n  in Chiang Mai](https://link.medium.com/UREEouDpe0). I also highly recommend\\n  doing a cooking class! [Thai Akha Kitchen](https://www.thaiakhakitchen.com/)\\n  is awesome. The lady is hilarious and she takes you to a market to shop first\\n  to try some goodies and get your ingredients. Super fun!  3) While these are a\\n  little touristy, I still think you can have a great time -  In the city: - Go\\n  temple hopping within the walled city. There are so many to see and all within\\n  walking distance of each other. - Sunday Night Market to get fun souvenirs or\\n  to just taste all the local deliciousness. - 6ixcret for a lady boy show!\\n  Seriously, so much fun. The cost is just 2 drinks during the show which they\\n  don’t really enforce.  - You can hike up to Doi Suthep temple. Do it early to\\n  catch the beautiful sunrise from the top (might involve some hiking in the\\n  dark though...)  Outside the city: - Doi Inthanon Park to visit the beautiful\\n  pagodas! There are hiking trails here too. - Sticky Waterfall to literally\\n  scale up a waterfall. Super fun! - Chiang Rai is a bit far, so this is\\n  definitely a day trip. Cool to see all the colored temples but if that’s not\\n  your shtick then I wouldn’t recommend going.  4) A couple of days stay is\\n  good! You could explore the within the city for 1-2 days, and also do some\\n  stuff outside the city for 1-2 days as well.   Getting around the city is easy\\n  too. You can use Grab (which is like their version of Uber/Lyft in most Asian\\n  cities). If you’d rather bike they have Mobike around the city for rental\\n  (you’ll need to download the app). Or you can just walk! The best and cheapest\\n  way is to use a red van. They drive all over the city so just flag one down\\n  and ask if they can take you where you wanna go. It’s a flat fee of 30 baht\\n  per person. It’s not the fastest way to get around but definitely one of the\\n  easiest on your wallet. You can also hail a bike/tuktuk too, but make sure to\\n  see how much it would cost on Grab first to help negotiate a good price.\\n  Hope that helps! :)\\n- I was there for five days in August and I have to say do “the monks walk” to\\n  wat pha lat! It’s amazing and my favorite thing I did in Chiang Mai.

Definitely check out an elephant sanctuary (no riding!) and taking a\\n  cooking class (I really liked Asian Scenic.) I loved looking at the temples,\\n  especially Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep and Wat Chedi Luang. Night market is\\n  definitely a must do. 2. Khao soi is the best! Street food is a really great\\n  way to try a little bit of everything. 3. Driving out to Huay Tung Tao lake\\n  was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can sit out on the lake and\\n  relax and eat.  4. I would say a week! If you\\'re into non-touristy stuff you\\n  might also enjoy checking out Chiang Rai, particularly the White Temple and\\n  the Black House.\\n- Hello! Chiang Mai is such a wonderful, unassuming city. So you’re already\\n  making a great decision to visit!  1) There are plenty of tours that offer to\\n  take you to see elephants. Just make sure you choose one that doesn’t let you\\n  ride them. I’ve done it with [Blue Elephant Thailand\\n  Tours](https://www.blueelephantthailandtours.com/) and since we did a super\\n  early morning one, it was like having a private session with the elephants. It\\n  was quite wonderful actually!   2) Read here for my fave spots - [Where to Eat\\n  in Chiang Mai](https://link.medium.com/UREEouDpe0). I also highly recommend\\n  doing a cooking class! [Thai Akha Kitchen](https://www.thaiakhakitchen.com/)\\n  is awesome. The lady is hilarious and she takes you to a market to shop first\\n  to try some goodies and get your ingredients. Super fun!  3) While these are a\\n  little touristy, I still think you can have a great time -  In the city: - Go\\n  temple hopping within the walled city. There are so many to see and all within\\n  walking distance of each other. - Sunday Night Market to get fun souvenirs or\\n  to just taste all the local deliciousness. - 6ixcret for a lady boy show!\\n  Seriously, so much fun. The cost is just 2 drinks during the show which they\\n  don’t really enforce.  - You can hike up to Doi Suthep temple. Do it early to\\n  catch the beautiful sunrise from the top (might involve some hiking in the\\n  dark though...)  Outside the city: - Doi Inthanon Park to visit the beautiful\\n  pagodas! There are hiking trails here too. - Sticky Waterfall to literally\\n  scale up a waterfall. Super fun! - Chiang Rai is a bit far, so this is\\n  definitely a day trip. Cool to see all the colored temples but if that’s not\\n  your shtick then I wouldn’t recommend going.  4) A couple of days stay is\\n  good! You could explore the within the city for 1-2 days, and also do some\\n  stuff outside the city for 1-2 days as well.   Getting around the city is easy\\n  too. You can use Grab (which is like their version of Uber/Lyft in most Asian\\n  cities). If you’d rather bike they have Mobike around the city for rental\\n  (you’ll need to download the app). Or you can just walk! The best and cheapest\\n  way is to use a red van. They drive all over the city so just flag one down\\n  and ask if they can take you where you wanna go. It’s a flat fee of 30 baht\\n  per person. It’s not the fastest way to get around but definitely one of the\\n  easiest on your wallet. You can also hail a bike/tuktuk too, but make sure to\\n  see how much it would cost on Grab first to help negotiate a good price.\\n  Hope that helps! :)\\n- I was there for five days in August and I have to say do “the monks walk” to\\n  wat pha lat! It’s amazing and my favorite thing I did in Chiang Mai.

      "3. **Visit Ethical Elephant Sanctuaries**: Visit places like Elephant Nature Park, Asian Elephant Projects, or Chang Chill. Avoid places that offer elephant bathing as it's not preferred by the elephants (Source 0).\n",

      "4. **Souvenir Shopping**: Warorot Market offers a wide variety of goods at cheaper prices than the night market. Baan Tawai village is also known for handmade items, mainly wood (Source 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Chill Bars and Music Venues**: North Gate Jazz Co-op is a popular spot for live music, and the White Rabbit is a recommended cocktail bar. Chiang Mai is generally safe, but avoid karaoke bars (Source 0, Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Traveling Around**: Stay near the moat and walk everywhere to explore Chiang Mai. Avoid renting scooters unless you have experience, as it's dangerous for beginners (Source 1).\n",

       "\n",
       "## Best Time to Visit\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai's peak tourist season aligns with its cooler and dry months from November to February. Visiting during this time not only allows you to enjoy the pleasant weather but also partake in the magical Yi Peng Lantern Festival, typically occurring in November[1][2]. However, bear in mind that this period can also be more crowded and pricey due to the influx of tourists. The summer months are less crowded but hotter and humid, with the rainy season stretching from June to October, which can bring afternoon storms[3].\n",

       "- **Wat Phra That Doi Suthep**: A must-visit temple located on a hilltop offering panoramic views of the city.\n",
       "- **Old City Temples**: Discover the rich history by visiting numerous temples like Wat Chedi Luang within the Old City.\n",
       "- **Night Markets**: Both the Saturday (Waulai) and Sunday (Thapae) Walking Street Markets are captivating with local crafts and street food, with the Sunday market being the largest[2].\n",
       "- **MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum**: Positioned outside the city, this gallery features compelling modern art installations tackling social themes[4].\n",
       "- **Huay Tung Tao Lake**: Venture to the lesser-known northwestern corner for striking sculptures and a hidden waterfall[5].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Local Culture and Etiquette\n",
       "\n",
       "Understanding local culture and etiquette is vital in Chiang Mai. Dress modestly when visiting temples and remove your shoes before entering. When interacting with locals, it's polite to return the traditional Thai greeting, the 'wai', by placing your hands together in a prayer-like position near your chest. Avoid elephant camps that exploit animals and aim to support ethical sanctuaries like the Elephant Nature Park, which promotes elephant welfare[6]. Additionally, while Pad Thai is famous, delve into local Northern Thai dishes for an authentic culinary experience[7].\n",

       "## Getting Around\n",
       "\n",
       "Navigating Chiang Mai is straightforward with several transport options:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Walking**: Ideal for exploring the Old City and areas around the moat; it's the best way to soak in the local atmosphere[8].\n",
       "- **Ride-hailing Apps**: Apps like Grab, Bold, Indriver, or Maxim provide a convenient and cost-effective way to travel around, avoiding the often overpriced tuk-tuks[9].\n",
       "- **Bicycles and Scooters**: While popular, scooters can be dangerous for inexperienced riders. Stick to bicycles around quieter streets if you prefer cycling.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Food and Dining\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai's culinary scene is a delectable adventure:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Khao Soi, Hunglae, and Sai Ua**: Signature dishes not to be missed. Kriti Panit is praised for its flavorful twists on Northern classics[10].\n",
       "- **Street Food**: Explore street food stalwarts like Suki Chang Puek for an authentic street dining experience.\n",
       "- **Bakery Delights**: Indulge in local bakery favorites like coconut pie cake at Baan Piem Suk[10].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Accommodation\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai offers a diverse range of accommodations to suit all budgets:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Nimman Area**: Known for its lively nightlife and café culture. Ideal for those seeking vibrant energy with plenty of dining options[11].\n",
       "- **Old City**: Perfect for history buffs, providing proximity to cultural sites and party spots like Zoe In Yellow[12].\n",
       "- **Boutique Hotels**: L Nimman Boutique Hotel offers a serene experience for those looking for modest luxury[13], while The Inside House provides a luxurious stay with private pools[14].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety and Health\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai is considered one of the safest cities in Southeast Asia, making it ideal for solo travelers[15]. Despite the low crime rates, exercise standard precautions such as avoiding dimly lit areas and being cautious of your surroundings at night. Remember to protect yourself from mosquito bites and stay hydrated, especially if visiting during the hotter months.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Budget Tips\n",
       "\n",
       "For those traveling on a budget, here are a few tips:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Public Transport**: Utilize shared songthaews (red trucks) for cheap travel within the city.\n",
       "- **Market Shopping**: Warorot Market provides a more budget-friendly shopping experience than the night markets[16].\n",
       "- **Cultural Entry**: Many temples are free to enter, though donations are appreciated. \n",
       "\n",
       "## Unique Experiences\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai offers experiences beyond the typical tourist trail:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sticky Waterfalls**: Embark on a natural adventure where you can climb up the unique limestone waterfalls[5].\n",
       "- **Erotic Garden**: For something different, visit this quirky garden en route to Lamphun[17].\n",
       "- **Twenty Mar Coffee Shop**: A café with a difference, including an attached exhibition space[18].\n",
