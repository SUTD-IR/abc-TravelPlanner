       "# Travel Guide to Chiang Mai\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai, located in the mountainous region of northern Thailand, is a city rich in history and culture. Known for its well-preserved Old City, stunning temples, and lush landscapes, it offers a more laid-back and traditional experience compared to the bustling capital of Bangkok. Whether you are exploring its ancient roots or partaking in modern adventures, Chiang Mai is a destination that gracefully blends the past with the present.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Best Time to Visit\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai experiences a tropical climate with three distinct seasons: the cool, the hot, and the rainy season. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cool Season (November to February):** This is the most popular time to visit Chiang Mai, with pleasantly cool temperatures, clear skies, and a range of festivals, including the famous Loy Krathong and Yi Peng Lantern Festivals usually in November.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Hot Season (March to May):** Expect temperature spikes during this period, which can be quite oppressive. However, it coincides with the Songkran Festival (Thai New Year) in mid-April, a vibrant and energetic event complete with city-wide water fights.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Rainy Season (June to October):** While the rain can be frequent, it transforms the region into a lush, green paradise. Travelers can take advantage of fewer crowds and lower prices, but should be prepared for occasional downpours.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Top Attractions\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai is a treasure trove of cultural and natural attractions.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Wat Phra That Doi Suthep:** This iconic temple, perched on a mountain overlooking the city, is a must-visit for its stunning architecture and panoramic views. Climbing the 309 steps to the temple is a revered pilgrimage for many.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Old City Temples:** Within the ancient moat and walls are quintessential temples such as Wat Chedi Luang and Wat Phra Singh, each offering unique histories and architectural splendor.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Chiang Mai Night Bazaar:** Perfect for shopping enthusiasts, this bustling market offers everything from traditional crafts to street food.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Elephant Nature Park:** A sanctuary and rescue center that focuses on the rehabilitation of elephants. It's a perfect spot for animal lovers wanting ethical interactions with these majestic creatures.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Local Culture and Etiquette\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai's culture is deeply rooted in Buddhism and local traditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Respect for Buddhism:** Always dress appropriately when visiting temples (shoulders and knees covered), and avoid touching statues or point at images of the Buddha with your feet.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Greeting Etiquette:** The traditional Thai greeting is a wai, where you place your palms together in a prayer-like position and bow slightly. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cultural Events:** Participate in or respectfully observe local festivals, offering a glimpse into the vibrant traditions of Chiang Mai, such as the colorful flower festival held in February.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Getting Around\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai is relatively easy to navigate, with several options for getting around:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Songthaews (Red Trucks):** An affordable and popular mode conveying shared rides that function like a bus/taxi hybrid.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuk-tuks:** A quick way around town, albeit pricier than songthaews. Negotiating fares upfront is advisable.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Bicycles and Motorbikes:** Renting bikes or scooters provides flexibility and is an ideal way to explore the city and its surroundings.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Public Transportation:** The city lacks an extensive public transport system, so visitors rely on the options above.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Food and Dining\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai is famous for its Northern Thai cuisine, which is distinct from the rest of Thailand.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Must-Try Dishes:** Enjoy Khao Soi, a spicy coconut curry soup, Sai Oua (Northern Thai sausage), and the ubiquitous Green Curry.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Dining Spots:** Visit Riverside on the Ping River for a quintessential dining experience or venture into local markets such as the Sunday Walking Street to taste street food delights.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Accommodation\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai offers a variety of accommodation options ranging from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Old City:** Good for proximity to main attractions and a bustling atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Nimmanhaemin Road:** Ideal for a more modern experience, with chic cafes, boutiques, and vibrant nightlife.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Outskirts of the City:** Consider staying at a homestay or resort for a more tranquil experience surrounded by nature.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety and Health\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai is generally a safe city, but precautions are always wise.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Traffic Caution:** Be vigilant while crossing streets and cautious of the chaotic nature of local driving, especially when renting motorbikes.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Health Tips:** Stay hydrated, use insect repellent, and consider vaccinations recommended by your health provider for Southeast Asia.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Budget Tips\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Affordable Travel:** Use songthaews for economical travel, and eat at local markets to enjoy authentic food at lower prices.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Bargain Shopping:** Negotiating prices, especially in markets, is commonplace and can help stretch your budget further.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Unique Experiences\n",
       "\n",
       "Chiang Mai offers a wealth of unique experiences beyond the usual sightseeing.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cooking Classes:** Participating in a traditional Thai cooking class provides both a souvenir and a new skill to take home.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Trekking and Hill Tribe Visits:** Organized tours offer insights into the life of the region's ethnic minority groups and stunning natural scenery.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Essential Phrases\n",
       "\n",
       "While many locals speak English, knowing a few Thai phrases can enhance your experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sawasdee (Khrap/Kha):** Hello (for men/women).\n",
       "- **Khop Khun (Khrap/Kha):** Thank you (for men/women).\n",
       "- **Mai Pen Rai:** No worries/It’s okay.\n",
       "- **Tao Rai?:** How much?\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Chiang Mai is a captivating blend of cultural depth and natural beauty. Planning your visit around the cooler months, immersing yourself in local traditions, and being open to new experiences can make your trip truly unforgettable. Don’t miss out on enjoying Chiang Mai’s rich culinary offerings and exploring its picturesque landscapes by foot or bike for an authentic view of the city."

We plan on staying 1-2 weeks. Right now we’re looking at\\nnimmaheim and east of old town; but really have no idea. Please suggest\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n- You are asking me where you should stay in Chiang  Mai ?  You should stay in\\n  the old city .\\n- Honestly I'd say east Old City. I'm staying in Nimman now and have to say I\\n  don't really get the appeal. There are some nice little side streets but\\n  theres also very busy main arteries that cut through the area and aside from\\n  that it just kinda seems a bit boring. Basically it doesn't really seem to be\\n  neighbourhoody and quiet enough to be quaint but its also too quiet to be\\n  lively if that makes sense.  Granted I've only been here a week so need to get\\n  out and explore more, and obviously it's likely far quieter than it would be\\n  pre-pandemic. But I would say for right now Old City, seems to have better\\n  streetfood options, lots of little local restaurants, more nightlife, more\\n  walkable, more to see and do in general.\\n- We love to eat street food and walk around. Where should we stay and what to\\n  do?   Right now we’re looking at nimmanheim, tha pae gate and santitham.\\n  Please suggest we really have no idea\\n- Santitham would be my vote since it’s so inexpensive and has lots of street\\n  food.  “Walkable” would suggest Old City, but the truth is, Chiang Mai is not\\n  a small city. Old City has lovely walks, but you’ll most likely have to rent a\\n  bike or take Grab taxis out of the area to see the other sights CM has to\\n  offer.\\n- Highly suggest Enantamer Poshtel. Pappy has great recs for anything you could\\n  possibly want. If you feel comfortable, rent a scooter to see the whole city\\n  in a couple days.\\n\\n#### URL\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/tv763h/where_to_stay_in_chiangmai_nimmanheim_or_east_old/\""

       " Document(metadata={'comments': '### Comments\\n- 1. Definitely check out an elephant sanctuary (no riding!) and taking a\\n  cooking class (I really liked Asian Scenic.) I loved looking at the temples,\\n  especially Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep and Wat Chedi Luang. Night market is\\n  definitely a must do. 2. Khao soi is the best! Street food is a really great\\n  way to try a little bit of everything. 3. Driving out to Huay Tung Tao lake\\n  was one of my favorite parts of our trip. You can sit out on the lake and\\n  relax and eat.  4. I would say a week! If you\\'re into non-touristy stuff you\\n  might also enjoy checking out Chiang Rai, particularly the White Temple and\\n  the Black House.\\n- Hello! Chiang Mai is such a wonderful, unassuming city. So you’re already\\n  making a great decision to visit!  1) There are plenty of tours that offer to\\n  take you to see elephants. Just make sure you choose one that doesn’t let you\\n  ride them. I’ve done it with [Blue Elephant Thailand\\n  Tours](https://www.blueelephantthailandtours.com/) and since we did a super\\n  early morning one, it was like having a private session with the elephants. It\\n  was quite wonderful actually!   2) Read here for my fave spots - [Where to Eat\\n  in Chiang Mai](https://link.medium.com/UREEouDpe0). I also highly recommend\\n  doing a cooking class! [Thai Akha Kitchen](https://www.thaiakhakitchen.com/)\\n  is awesome. The lady is hilarious and she takes you to a market to shop first\\n  to try some goodies and get your ingredients. Super fun!  3) While these are a\\n  little touristy, I still think you can have a great time -  In the city: - Go\\n  temple hopping within the walled city. There are so many to see and all within\\n  walking distance of each other. - Sunday Night Market to get fun souvenirs or\\n  to just taste all the local deliciousness. - 6ixcret for a lady boy show!\\n  Seriously, so much fun. The cost is just 2 drinks during the show which they\\n  don’t really enforce.  - You can hike up to Doi Suthep temple. Do it early to\\n  catch the beautiful sunrise from the top (might involve some hiking in the\\n  dark though...)  Outside the city: - Doi Inthanon Park to visit the beautiful\\n  pagodas! There are hiking trails here too. - Sticky Waterfall to literally\\n  scale up a waterfall. Super fun! - Chiang Rai is a bit far, so this is\\n  definitely a day trip. Cool to see all the colored temples but if that’s not\\n  your shtick then I wouldn’t recommend going.  4) A couple of days stay is\\n  good! You could explore the within the city for 1-2 days, and also do some\\n  stuff outside the city for 1-2 days as well.   Getting around the city is easy\\n  too. You can use Grab (which is like their version of Uber/Lyft in most Asian\\n  cities). If you’d rather bike they have Mobike around the city for rental\\n  (you’ll need to download the app). Or you can just walk! The best and cheapest\\n  way is to use a red van. They drive all over the city so just flag one down\\n  and ask if they can take you where you wanna go. It’s a flat fee of 30 baht\\n  per person. It’s not the fastest way to get around but definitely one of the\\n  easiest on your wallet. You can also hail a bike/tuktuk too, but make sure to\\n  see how much it would cost on Grab first to help negotiate a good price.\\n  Hope that helps! :)\\n- I was there for five days in August and I have to say do “the monks walk” to\\n  wat pha lat! It’s amazing and my favorite thing I did in Chiang Mai. Here’s\\n  the [guide](https://www.globotreks.com/destinations/thailand-\\n  destinations/hiking-monks-trail-wat-pha-lat-chiang-mai/)  I used.\\n- I completely fell in love with the city once I had a motorbike. You\\'ll be able\\n  to go to all the places, see all the things, eat all the foods, whenever you\\n  want. If you\\'re feeling adventurous at all I cannot recommend this enough.\\n- Elephant Nature Park is the best! One of my favourite days ever. Book well in\\n  advance.   I stayed 4 nights, but would have happily stayed longer. Such a\\n  lovely place. Doi Suthep is definitely worth visiting. We walked around a lot,\\n  had amazing coffee at various coffee shops, and enjoyed local cuisine.\\n- I really enjoyed the night bazaar and the food vendors there. Delicious food.\\n  Definitely eat Khao Soi, as far as cooking classes go, I’ve used “Cooking\\n  @home Chiang Mai” on two occasions and it was both fun and delicious.\\n- We did a cooking class at Mama Noi’s and it was one of the best highlights of\\n  our trip! Would especially recommend since you mention liking food! The food\\n  we made there was amazing and it was a really fun experience.\\n- [deleted]\\n- For a day/ maybe 2 day trip you can take a van north to pai! very pretty and\\n  calm town, it’s very scenic and full of nature to explore. also about an hour\\n  outside of Chiang Mai there was a waterfall called “sticky waterfall”. because\\n  of the calcium deposits in it, you can pretty easily just walk up the\\n  waterfall. it was a blast and i would recommend looking into it\\n- >2) What are some of the must have food? (I have heard that Khao soi is\\n  amazing)  If you\\'ve never had it you\\'ll like Khao Soi but if you get a chance\\n  visit a Lanna (northern Thai) restaurant as there\\'s so much more to Lanna\\n  food. Two recommended dishes - Gaeng Hung Lay and Nam Prik Ong but there are\\n  plenty of others and it\\'s completely different to central Thai food, the Thai\\n  food you get in restaurants overseas.   >3) What are some of the must go to\\n  locations that are not that touristy?  If you\\'ve got enough time and can get\\n  the transport, [Wat\\n  Chalermprakiat](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/gallery/lampang-thailand-\\n  gallery/index.html?gallery=0) in Lampang, the so-called \"temple in the clouds\"\\n  is well worth a visit.  Because its takes about two hours to get to and it\\'s a\\n  little out of the way it\\'s not inundated with tourists - there are tourists\\n  but nothing like the closer, better known Wats like Wat Phra That Doi Suthep.\\n  Chae Son National Park which is about 30-45 minutes north of there is also\\n  worth a visit - natural hot springs.  Depending on what time of the year\\n  you\\'re visiting Doi Inthanon, Thailand\\'s highest mountain is also worth\\n  visiting. I note time of year as while it\\'s quiet now it\\'s inundated with\\n  thousands of tourists every day over cold season (Dec-Feb) as it\\'s about the\\n  only place in Thailand that gets regular frosts and even below 0c. Cold\\n  temperatures are a massive novelty for domestic Thai tourists.\\n- Get a road bike and ride to Doi Pui. I did it yesterday and the view was\\n  breathtaking.  https://scontent.fbkk12-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/71946989_10102\\n  533563552145_1443079204382965760_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=AQl2XmzyCOucaF7Ukvgb\\n  sL01GljEgNQXCjLVYrHknh0-edyIhycBdsPlbJ2yfkTiaF8&_nc_ht=scontent.fbkk12-2.fna&o\\n  h=d563fde8e4d34d2ef8c649f2cfd4128e&oe=5DF1264D\\n- Alway have a good Time at Corner Bistro DnB and hiphop nights', 'content': 'My partner and I are planning to visit Chaing Mai and would love suggestions to some questions based on your experiences.

It\\n  was quite wonderful actually!   2) Read here for my fave spots - [Where to Eat\\n  in Chiang Mai](https://link.medium.com/UREEouDpe0). I also highly recommend\\n  doing a cooking class! [Thai Akha Kitchen](https://www.thaiakhakitchen.com/)\\n  is awesome. The lady is hilarious and she takes you to a market to shop first\\n  to try some goodies and get your ingredients. Super fun!  3) While these are a\\n  little touristy, I still think you can have a great time -  In the city: - Go\\n  temple hopping within the walled city. There are so many to see and all within\\n  walking distance of each other. - Sunday Night Market to get fun souvenirs or\\n  to just taste all the local deliciousness. - 6ixcret for a lady boy show!\\n  Seriously, so much fun. The cost is just 2 drinks during the show which they\\n  don’t really enforce.  - You can hike up to Doi Suthep temple. Do it early to\\n  catch the beautiful sunrise from the top (might involve some hiking in the\\n  dark though...)  Outside the city: - Doi Inthanon Park to visit the beautiful\\n  pagodas! There are hiking trails here too. - Sticky Waterfall to literally\\n  scale up a waterfall. Super fun! - Chiang Rai is a bit far, so this is\\n  definitely a day trip. Cool to see all the colored temples but if that’s not\\n  your shtick then I wouldn’t recommend going.  4) A couple of days stay is\\n  good! You could explore the within the city for 1-2 days, and also do some\\n  stuff outside the city for 1-2 days as well.   Getting around the city is easy\\n  too. You can use Grab (which is like their version of Uber/Lyft in most Asian\\n  cities). If you’d rather bike they have Mobike around the city for rental\\n  (you’ll need to download the app). Or you can just walk! The best and cheapest\\n  way is to use a red van. They drive all over the city so just flag one down\\n  and ask if they can take you where you wanna go. It’s a flat fee of 30 baht\\n  per person. It’s not the fastest way to get around but definitely one of the\\n  easiest on your wallet. You can also hail a bike/tuktuk too, but make sure to\\n  see how much it would cost on Grab first to help negotiate a good price.\\n  Hope that helps! :)\\n- I was there for five days in August and I have to say do “the monks walk” to\\n  wat pha lat!

Depending on what time of the year\\n  you\\'re visiting Doi Inthanon, Thailand\\'s highest mountain is also worth\\n  visiting. I note time of year as while it\\'s quiet now it\\'s inundated with\\n  thousands of tourists every day over cold season (Dec-Feb) as it\\'s about the\\n  only place in Thailand that gets regular frosts and even below 0c.

       "# Chiang Mai Travel Guide\n",
       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "Chiang Mai, often dubbed the \"Rose of the North,\" is a culturally rich and historic city in Thailand, renowned for its ancient temples, vibrant festivals, and beautiful landscapes. Whether you're seeking adventure in the surrounding mountains or exploring the vibrant local culture, Chiang Mai offers a diverse range of experiences for every traveler.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Best Time to Visit\n",
       "Chiang Mai is best visited during the cooler months from November to February, when the weather is pleasant for outdoor activities and exploring the city's attractions[1]. This period is ideal as it avoids the hot summer months and the monsoon rains, offering a comfortable environment for tourists.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Top Attractions\n",
       "**MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum** offers a unique insight into contemporary Thai art, with many installations addressing social issues[1]. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Wat Mae Kaet Noi (Hell Temple)** in San Sai is another exceptional site, known for its thought-provoking statues[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sticky Waterfalls (Namtok Bua Thong)** provide a unique natural experience where visitors can walk up the waterfall due to the sticky nature of the limestone rocks[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "For a quieter, scenic outing, **Mae Kuang Dam** offers beautiful vistas and a peaceful atmosphere[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Local Culture and Etiquette\n",
       "When it comes to local customs, visiting **Elephant Nature Park** instead of elephant camps is advised, as it is one of the few ethical sanctuaries focusing on the welfare of the animals[1]. It is important to show respect for the local culture by trying authentic northern Thai dishes and dressing modestly when visiting temples.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Getting Around\n",
       "Transportation apps like **Grab**, **Bolt**, **Indriver**, or **Maxim** are recommended for traveling around Chiang Mai, offering affordable rates compared to Tuktuks, which are often more of a tourist attraction with higher fares[1]. The city is also walkable, especially around the Old City and Nimman area.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Food and Dining\n",
       "**Khao Soi**, a northern Thai curry noodle dish, is a must-try and highly recommended at restaurants like KHAO-SO-I[1]. Try local delicacies like **Nam Prik Ong**, **Guang Hung Lay**, and **Sai Ua** to experience the rich flavors of Lanna cuisine[1]. More adventurous palates can sample an all-you-can-eat BBQ pork, popular among locals and students[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Accommodation\n",
       "For modern vibes, the **Nimman Area** boasts chic cafes and boutique hotels, offering a slightly upscale experience. The **Old City** is ideal for those on a moderate budget, rich in history and culture with proximity to traditional markets and iconic temples. **Near Thapae Gate** offers budget-friendly options close to the bustling night markets, suitable for those wanting to stay in the heart of the action[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety and Health\n",
       "Chiang Mai is considered very safe for solo travelers, regularly ranking as the safest city in Southeast Asia[1]. However, tourists should avoid karaoke bars and be mindful of traffic, especially when crossing roads, as drivers do not typically slow down for pedestrians[1]. Pack a rain poncho for unexpected afternoon storms to avoid getting wet while exploring[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Budget Tips\n",
       "To make your visit affordable, stay near local markets like **Warorot Market**, where you can find items cheaper than in the tourist-oriented night markets[1]. Avoid Tuktuks for longer journeys and make use of ridesharing apps for economical transportation[1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Unique Experiences\n",
       "Visit the quirky **Erotic Garden** or the hidden **Twenty Mar Coffee Shop** with its exhibition space for unique and off-the-beaten-path experiences[1]. Take the opportunity to explore lesser-known cafes like **So Cool Café**, which features creative decor and fish tanks made from old TVs[1].\n",
