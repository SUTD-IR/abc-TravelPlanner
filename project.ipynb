       "\"# Yi Peng/Loi Krathong 2024\\n\\n## Original Post\\n\\nHey everyone!  My Girl and me want to visit Thailand in November. We saw that\\naround the 15./16. of November there will be the Yi Peng and Loi Krathong\\nfestivities in Chiang Mai. It is not easy to get an overview of what to expect\\nthere. So I am grateful for any information!   So here are a few questions:  -\\nDo we need to attend the paid festival by CAD? Or is this just a touristic cash\\ngrab? - Where to get a lantern? - Are we allowed to let a lantern start from\\nwithin the city?  - What is a “must see” at that time in Chiang mai? e.g. any\\nspecial ceremonies? Parades? - Is there like a timetable what is happening when\\nin the city?   Thank & Cheers!\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n- There is events you can pay to go, but I would advise against it. It's very\\n  simple festival, go to any bridge on the ping river, there is lanterns\\n  everywhere to buy from street vendors, you can buy flowers to set on the water\\n  etc. You dont have to stress to much about time, when the sun goes down around\\n  7 is when you can expect the lanterns to raise to the air. Go have a nice\\n  dinner near ping river (Riverside or The Dukes, and when dinner is done go to\\n  the river and enjoy the sights and buy some lanterns and some flower\\n  decorations to give to the water spirits ( which is from my understanding what\\n  the whole festival Loi Krathong is about)   I hired a photographer for 2 hours\\n  in 2017 and got some amazing shots with me and my family.\\n- Hey, I was in CM for Yi Peng/Loi Krathong last November, it was very good. No\\n  need to go to the paid festival, the city centre (particularly around the\\n  river area) is absolutely buzzing with people/festivities and decorated\\n  beautifully.  In terms of launching lanterns from the city - people seemed to\\n  be launching them mostly from Nawarat Bridge (literally hundreds, maybe\\n  thousands). I can't endorse this though as it's banned due to fire risk. It\\n  also can't be great for the environment / wildlife. Unfortunately there was a\\n  big fire last year that took hours to put out\\n  (https://www.nationthailand.com/thailand/general/40033278). I witnessed it\\n  from my balcony and it was a very sad sight. Apparently this has happed in\\n  previous years too. Fortunately I think nobody was hurt, but people probably\\n  lost homes, or at very least businesses.  Other than that, it was a really\\n  great festival. CM (and Thailand in general) has some of the strongest\\n  festival game I've ever seen. Each one truly magical and memorable. And yes,\\n  there was parade around the perimeter of the Old City on one of the last days,\\n  that was good too.  One thing I'd say is to try and book accommodation and\\n  flights (if that's how you'll be travelling) well in advance as a lot of\\n  people visit CM for this festival. I was there for the the whole of November\\n  and the influx was very noticeable. Afterwards, as my departure from CM\\n  happened to coincide with the end of Yi Peng/Loi Krathong, I ended up having\\n  to get a 10hr bus to BKK to just get a reasonably priced last(ish) minute\\n  flight to HCM as this was \\\\~$300 from CM (usually $50-70 for this route). I\\n  imagine it would've been cheaper from CM if I'd booked more in advance.  Have\\n  a great time! I love CM so much, one of my favourite places in the world. If\\n  you have time, drive \\\\~20mins from the centre (or get a Grab taxi for \\\\~300\\n  bhat) to Royal Park Rajapruek. Afterwards, you can also drive/taxi 5-10min up\\n  to Wat Phra That Doi Kham, the temple overlooking the park + has a great view\\n  over CM (if you go up by Grab taxi you may have to get a songthaew back down\\n  though as I'm not sure if Grab collect from up there, or perhaps you could try\\n  and tipping the Grab driver that took you up to wait for you). This area is\\n  truly special and relatively unknown / unvisited by tourists as it's a bit out\\n  of town.\\n- The paid event is worth it if you dgaf about the cost and want something less\\n  crowded and organized including transportation to/from and everything planned\\n  out.  There’s a free event at doi saket lakes which is fun but insanely\\n  overcrowded. It’s absolutely crazy how many people are here for it. We’re\\n  already sold out of beds for this year.\\n\\n#### URL\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/1cb3fx4/yi_pengloi_krathong_2024/\""

       " Document(metadata={'comments': '### Comments\\n- Sticky waterfall: a wonder that will mess with your brain.   North gate jazz\\n  co-op: little jazz bar that always seems like the only place in Chiangmai full\\n  of people. Open mike nights and very lively.   Elely cafe: little riverside\\n  cafe with 2 elephants. Which are massively overshadowed by about 20\\n  dachshunds.\\n- I spent a month in CM and put this [Chiang Mai\\n  guide](https://travelhiatus.com/the-perfect-4-days-in-chiang-mai-itinerary/)\\n  together, hope it helps :)\\n- Stay near the moat. Walk everywhere. Avoid nothing (except elephant camps and\\n  those crazy “hill tribe camps”). Try whatever catches your eye. Try any food.\\n  Why do you want to do what others have already done? It’s your trip. Make it\\n  your trip. Night markets will have souvenir-y things. Why sit in a bar? If you\\n  will, sit in a bar with live music. You’ll hear/finds lots around the moat and\\n  in the old city. You only have 4 days. Don’t rent scooters. Walk. Everywhere.\\n  Have fun.\\n- 1: Avoid - Afternoon storms. This is the time to sit at a bar/cafe and watch\\n  the world splash by. (with mosquito coils under the table).  2: Food - Try\\n  everything but bugs   3: Visit - If the heat gets to you, try Doi Inthanon, it\\n  can be actually quite cool up there. I would stay overnight at one of the\\n  bungalows on the rice paddy\\'s on a small farm. There are several waterfalls in\\n  the area and great ma & pa coffee stalls. Weekdays are quite peaceful.  4:\\n  Elephant camps - Havnt been, not for me but if you haven\\'t been then you can\\'t\\n  really express a public opinion so find the most humane one and go.  5:\\n  Trinkets- CM is the market capital of the north so many options. Even though\\n  the Sunday market is so busy and touristy, some locals make their own stuff\\n  and sell here. The village of Baan Tawai has lots of hand made items, mainly\\n  wood, so customs declaration required going home.  6: Chill bars- There are\\n  just so many in the old city, Nimman, and surrounds, all safe. There are a\\n  range of rooftop bars from hi-so to lay layback venues, googs has a list. As\\n  mentioned, North Gate Jazz is popular but gets busy with patrons flowing out\\n  to the street. Lost Hut was cute and Zoe for the backpacker crew who like doof\\n  doof dancing. Lots of upmarket wine bars/beer labs in Nimman. Some nice venues\\n  across the river like Riverside, with live music and ramshackle wooden shack\\n  atmosphere, with the popular Thai venue, Good View, just up the road.

North gate jazz\\n  co-op: little jazz bar that always seems like the only place in Chiangmai full\\n  of people. Open mike nights and very lively.   Elely cafe: little riverside\\n  cafe with 2 elephants. Which are massively overshadowed by about 20\\n  dachshunds.\\n- I spent a month in CM and put this [Chiang Mai\\n  guide](https://travelhiatus.com/the-perfect-4-days-in-chiang-mai-itinerary/)\\n  together, hope it helps :)\\n- Stay near the moat. Walk everywhere. Avoid nothing (except elephant camps and\\n  those crazy “hill tribe camps”). Try whatever catches your eye. Try any food.\\n  Why do you want to do what others have already done? It’s your trip. Make it\\n  your trip. Night markets will have souvenir-y things. Why sit in a bar? If you\\n  will, sit in a bar with live music. You’ll hear/finds lots around the moat and\\n  in the old city. You only have 4 days. Don’t rent scooters. Walk. Everywhere.\\n  Have fun.\\n- 1: Avoid - Afternoon storms. This is the time to sit at a bar/cafe and watch\\n  the world splash by. (with mosquito coils under the table).  2: Food - Try\\n  everything but bugs   3: Visit - If the heat gets to you, try Doi Inthanon, it\\n  can be actually quite cool up there. I would stay overnight at one of the\\n  bungalows on the rice paddy\\'s on a small farm. There are several waterfalls in\\n  the area and great ma & pa coffee stalls. Weekdays are quite peaceful.  4:\\n  Elephant camps - Havnt been, not for me but if you haven\\'t been then you can\\'t\\n  really express a public opinion so find the most humane one and go.  5:\\n  Trinkets- CM is the market capital of the north so many options. Even though\\n  the Sunday market is so busy and touristy, some locals make their own stuff\\n  and sell here. The village of Baan Tawai has lots of hand made items, mainly\\n  wood, so customs declaration required going home.  6: Chill bars- There are\\n  just so many in the old city, Nimman, and surrounds, all safe. There are a\\n  range of rooftop bars from hi-so to lay layback venues, googs has a list. As\\n  mentioned, North Gate Jazz is popular but gets busy with patrons flowing out\\n  to the street. Lost Hut was cute and Zoe for the backpacker crew who like doof\\n  doof dancing. Lots of upmarket wine bars/beer labs in Nimman. Some nice venues\\n  across the river like Riverside, with live music and ramshackle wooden shack\\n  atmosphere, with the popular Thai venue, Good View, just up the road. Go early\\n  and sit at the bar and watch the band get going, probably 90% locals.  7:\\n  Advice - Grab a rain poncho at the 7/11 and go with the flow\\n- 4. Elephant Nature Park. That\\'s the one. That\\'s the only one you should visit.\\n  Virtually all the rest of them are privately owned, for-profit places with a\\n  long history of abuse. Please don\\'t support the other places.\\n- visited elephant sanctuary a month ago. got to feed, scratch and bathe with\\n  elephants. that was pretty neat.  no riding or other circus activities\\n- Hung Lay curry.\\n- 1) Don\\'t use Tuktuks for transportation, use Grab, Bold, Indriver or Maxim. If\\n  you want to just try a Tuktuk for fun go for it, but it\\'s mostly a tourist\\n  thing and prices are much higher that other transport.   2) Pad Thai is mostly\\n  a tourist dish and most Thai people don\\'t really eat it. Try if of course but\\n  there\\'s much better dishes. Most popular dish in Thailand with locals is Pad\\n  krapow (stir fried port with basil). But just try lots of different things.\\n  3) Not sure about underrated but Doi Suthep temple is nice, various\\n  waterfalls, night market.  4) Elephant Nature Park is the most famous one and\\n  is nice if you want to spend the day walking around with elephants, bathing\\n  them etc. If you want something more relaxed then Chai Lai Orchid is nice.\\n  They have a cafe so you can just go and eat or have a drink and they have\\n  elephants wallking around.
